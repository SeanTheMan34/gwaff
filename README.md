Originally made for the Mumbo Jumbo Discord server.
**So it might need a few modifications to get it to work how you'd like it too.**


## Steps to use for your own server
1. ["Fork this"](https://github.com/bwac2517/gwaff/fork) or [download it](https://github.com/bwac2517/gwaff/archive/master.zip) and use it locally.
2. Next, edit the [config.yml](https://github.com/bwac2517/gwaff/blob/master/config.yml)
```server_id: 377946908783673344 # your server id
darkmode: true # dark mode or not
title: "GWAFF V2"
bottom_message: "\nCheck out the github on bwac2517/gwaff"
plot:
  range: 60 # how many users to include in the plots
  minium_xp: 500 # anyone with a xp gain below this will not be included in the plots
  rank_range: 20 # the interval it starts a new graph
bar:
  range: 15 # how many users to include in the bar graph
versus: # the versus plot, change to just 0000000000000 to be blank
  - 298294667219435521
  - 387259938977742849
  - 477148794861912084
  - 724378805728313395
data:
  range: 300
```
3. You should [make a venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).  
Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run `python3 gwaff.py --store` every day to collect xp data (at the same time of day to keep consistency) (Use a github action for this to automate it)  
This is saved in `gwaff.json` **strongly recommended you use git incase you want to roll back any unwanted saves**

5. You can generate a graphs with `python3 gwaff.py --plot --save`, or use `python3 gwaff.py --store --plot --save` to save mee6 data AND plot it at the same time.  
**you can use `python3 gwaff.py --store --plot --save --post {A discord webhook url}` to post to discord at the same time**. 

6. **RECOMMENDED**
- [Copy this gist](https://gist.github.com/bwac2517/f979c98e9b8a24ec44a646346f988622) to your fork in the path `.github/workflows/data-collection.yml`
- In your fork settings, go to "Secrets" and make one called `WEBHOOK_URL` (use that exact name)
- Make a discord channel and create a webhook, copy the url for the webhook and enter it into the `WEBHOOK_URL`
